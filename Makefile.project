# The common name of the package.
#
# For a library package this is either the library's simple name, else it is the
# library's simple name prefixed by "lib".  Ideally it is the same as the base
# of PKGNAME in the pkgsrc module.

# Building Documentation:
#
# The documentation is all currently within comments in the source code and we
# use Cxref to extract it and turn it into something more useful and coherent,
# which by default is a set of HTML pages.  This has the added advantage of
# providing a comprehensive hyperlinked cross-reference of all the types and
# functions in all of the source files.
#
# Cxref can be found at:  https://www.gedanken.org.uk/software/cxref/
#
# It is included in Homebrew and a package is available for Ubuntu Linux.
#
# If cxref is not available then set CXREF=true on the make command-line.
#
# See doc/Makefile.
