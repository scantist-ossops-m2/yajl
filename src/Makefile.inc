# N.B.:  ${.CURDIR} here is not needed -- it's already implied because of the

.include "../Makefile.inc"

# XXX there's something odd about sjg's Mk-files.
#
# For some unknown reason <subdir.mk> does .-include <${.CURDIR}/Makefile.inc>.
# No other BSD-based Mk-files does this.  This should be fixed eventually.
#
# Also until very recently BMake (and NetBSD make) didn't implement
# .INCLUDEDFROMFILE or .INCLUDEDFROMDIR correctly!  It may have worked a long
# time ago, but was broken for some time.  This was probably fixed in NetBSD
# make with the following change:

# revision 1.281
# date: 2020-09-05 11:18:05 -0700;  author: rillig;  state: Exp;  lines: +60 -66;  commitid: 6IOaNyfoXI226TmC;
# make(1): fix .INCLUDEDFROMDIR/.INCLUDEDFROMFILE
#
# So it is possibly fixed in BMake 20200911, and certainly in 20200927.
#
# xxx so this hack only works with more recent versions of BMake.  Sadly that
# doesn't include the GitHub Ubuntu 22.04 runner with BMake 20200710.
