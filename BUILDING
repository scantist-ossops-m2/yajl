Short story:

	mkdir build
	MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX=$(pwd -P)/build bmake
	MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX=$(pwd -P)/build bmake PREFIX=/usr/local install

You can also create an archive for installing on other like systems
with:

	MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX=$(pwd -P)/build bmake PREFIX=/usr/local DESTDIR=$(pwd -P)/dist install
	( cd dist && pax -wzf ../yajl-$(uname -s)-$(uname -r)-$(uname -m).tar.gz . )

WARNING:  Do not specify DESTDIR for the first (build) phase!

(where "bsdmake" is of course a 'make' of the BSD persuasion,
e.g. "make" on BSDs, "bsdmake" on older Darwin/OSX, or "bmake" on
other non-BSD-based systems.)

See also the comments in the top-level Makefile for more hints about
issues with various mk-files (also some more comments in Makefile.inc).

When things go wrong:

Acquire and install BMake and its Mk-files and try again.

NOTES:

- some mk-files support a "regress" target which can be used to run
  all the tests from the top level of the source tree -- if yours
  doesn't you can go into the tests, example, and perf directories
  directly and run "make regress" in each, adding MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX as
  necessary

- bmake from http://pkgsrc.org/ is another good option, though it
  currently has some issues with shared libraries on platforms which
  cannot use GNU binutils, such as OSX/Darwin (but see Makefile for a
  work-around to avoid building a shared library -- you really don't
  need it anyway)

- Cxref is used to build the documentation from comments in the source
  code.  Cxref is in pkgsrc in the devel/cxref module and can also be
  found at https://www.gedanken.org.uk/software/cxref/

  If you do not have "cxref" installed you can disable the creation of
  HTML documentation (and its install) by setting "MKDOC=no":

	MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX=$(pwd -P)/build bmake MKDOC=no
	MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX=$(pwd -P)/build bmake PREFIX=/usr/local MKDOC=no
